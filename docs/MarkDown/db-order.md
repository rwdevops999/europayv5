# ORDER TO BE KEPT

For next tables order is important. After each clean of the table, the sequence must be reset.

- All IAM entities (services, statements, ...)
- countries
- address
- OTP

The rest is not important because:

- id doesn't matter (llokup by name like templates and exports, or type like settings, or just additional like history, jobs, tasks)
